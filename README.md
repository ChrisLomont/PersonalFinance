# Chris Lomont's Financial Planner 
Monte Carlo financial planning tool

TODO - screen shot

TODO - roadmap

## Models and usage
Run the program, open the file DemoModel.json to see an example.
For your own use, fillin another model file with a text editor. For the format
see the file itself and read the ModelFormat.md file explaining fields.

## TODO
Things to implement
1. Separate the spreadsheet page into another window, giving more room for each
2. Save some UI state in the model to reload where one
3. Slider to see the various MonteCarlo spread sheets instead of merging them all into a mess.
4. More auto compute stuff - when an input to a calc changes (like mortgage, ss, loan) - auto compute the other parameters
